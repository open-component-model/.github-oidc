# GitHub OIDC Federation

This repository contains the OIDC federation configuration to allow trust-based access of the
repositories contained in the `open-component-model` organization. See below for more information
on the [GitHub OIDC Federation service](https://github.com/gardener/github-oidc-federation).

# GitHub OIDC Federation Service

The GitHub OIDC Federation service provides the capability to exchange an OIDC identity token for
a short-lived GitHub access token. Hence, it allows cross GitHub instance/organization/repository
access without the need for static credentials (e.g. GitHub service accounts, GitHub App private
keys). The short-lived GitHub access tokens are created by a central GitHub App for the individual
requesters. The federated access is managed in the `.github-oidc` repository (`.github` for GHE) of
the target GitHub organization, via a `oidc-federation.(yaml|json)` file.

> [!NOTE]  
> By design, the central GitHub App must be granted all the permissions requesters should be able to
> request, and must be installed into the target GitHub organization with access to its repositories
> (including the `.github-oidc` or `.github` repository).

## OIDC Federation Configuration

To configure the federated access, a `oidc-federation.(yaml|json)` file is required in the target
organization's `.github-oidc` (`.github` for GHE) repository. It is used to map the supported issuer
and subject/token claim to the allowed repositories and permissions. Example:

```yaml
- issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  subject: repo:gardener/github-oidc-federation:ref:refs/heads/main
  permissions: # can be omitted for full access
    contents: read
  repositories: # can be omitted for global organization access
    - github-oidc-federation
- issuer: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
  principals:
    - repository: gardener/github-oidc-federation
      ref: refs/heads/foo
```

## Token Request

To request a short-lived GitHub access token, a POST request to the `/token-exchange` endpoint must
be done including the desired GitHub `host` and `organization` as well as the identity `token` and
requested `permissions`. Optionally, the GitHub `repositories` can be specified to limit the scope
of the access token. Example:

```bash
curl -sLS -X POST "<token-server-url>/token-exchange" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "host": "github.com",
    "organization": "gardener",
    "token": "<identity-token>",
    "repositories": ["github-oidc-federation"],
    "permissions": {
      "contents": "read"
    }
  }'
```

## Supported Permissions

The supported permissions are mapped to the permissions of the central GitHub App in use. For a full
list of available permissions for GitHub Apps, please refer to the
[documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/authentication/permissions-required-for-github-apps).
The permission names are expected to be in kebab-case format.

## Usage in GitHub Actions

To generate a short-lived GitHub access token from within GitHub Actions, please use the available
[gardener/cc-utils/.github/actions/github-auth@master](https://github.com/gardener/cc-utils/tree/master/.github/actions/github-auth)
Action. Example:

```yaml
- uses: gardener/cc-utils/.github/actions/github-auth@master
  id: token
  with:
    token-server: ${{ vars.FEDERATED_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN_SERVER }}
    host: github.com # defaults to current GitHub host
    organization: gardener # defaults to current GitHub owner
    repositories: | # defaults to all repositories of the specified `organization`
      github-oidc-federation
      cc-utils
    permissions: | # defaults to `contents: read`
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write
- shell: bash
  run: |
    echo "${{ steps.token.outputs.token }}"
```
